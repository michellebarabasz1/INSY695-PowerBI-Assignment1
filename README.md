# Sales and Marketing Dashboard for Mountain Wheels Superstore
The project involved developing a comprehensive sales and marketing dashboard for Mountain Wheels Superstore using Power BI. Utilizing various datasets including sales, customer details, product categories, and returns, the dashboard provided actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Three key questions were addressed: analyzing total sales revenue by product category across multiple years, identifying territories, product categories, and sub-categories with the highest return rates, and examining customer demographics breakdown over time. Solutions were presented in Power BI reports and Word documents, detailing steps taken, visualizations created, and implications for business stakeholders.
